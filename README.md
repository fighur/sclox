# sclox

Lox interpreter from the book ["Crafting Interpreters"](http://craftinginterpreters.com) implemented in Scala 3.

Usage:
* To compile it run `sbt compile`.
* To test it you can use the helper bash script `run_tests.sh`. It uses the testing infrastructure from the [original repository](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) (this is why Dart is the dominant language).
* To run it you can use the helper bash script `sclox`.
